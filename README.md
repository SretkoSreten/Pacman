# Pacman Game

The Pacman Game is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by millions of players worldwide. This GitHub repository contains the source code and assets for the Pacman game, allowing you to play and customize the game according to your preferences.

## Gameplay

In the Pacman game, the player controls a character named Pacman, represented by a small yellow circle. The objective is to navigate through a maze while eating all the dots or pellets scattered throughout. However, the game isn't that simple as there are four ghosts that are constantly chasing Pacman and trying to catch him.

The player must guide Pacman through the maze, avoiding the ghosts' paths and strategically eating power pellets that temporarily allow Pacman to turn the tables and chase the ghosts. When Pacman eats a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue, becoming vulnerable and allowing Pacman to eat them for extra points.

The game consists of multiple levels, with each level becoming progressively more challenging. As the player advances, the ghosts become faster and more difficult to evade. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by eating all the pellets and avoiding being caught by the ghosts.
